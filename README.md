# Constraint-based optimization algorithms from the Chandrasekaran Lab
This repository contains code that can be used to integrate multiple -omics data and analyze constraint-based metabolic reconstructions. 

## Dependencies
Many functions in this repository require the [`cobratoolbox`](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/) or [`cobrapy`](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy) libraries for specific modeling tasks. Additionally, the [Gurobi solver](https://www.gurobi.com/) is required for optimization problems.
